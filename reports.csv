 About the Shared National Credit Program

The Shared National Credit (SNC) Program assesses risk in the largest and most complex credit
facilities shared by regulated financial institutions (banks) and nonbank investors (nonbanks). The
SNC Program is governed by an interagency agreement among the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency (the agencies). The program began in 1977 to review borrowers with
minimum aggregate loan commitments totaling $20 million or more that were shared by two or
more regulated financial institutions (banks). A program modification in 1998 increased the
minimum number of regulated financial institutions from two to three. To adjust for inflation and
changes in average loan size, the agencies increased the minimum aggregate loan commitment
threshold from $20 million to $100 million effective January 1, 2018.

SNC reviews are completed in the first and third quarters of the calendar year. Large agent banks
receive two reviews each year while a selection of other agent banks receive a single review each
year. The results discussed in this document reflect reviews conducted in the first and third
quarters of 2023, and primarily cover loan commitments originated on or before June 30, 2023.

Trends and exhibits shown in the report include outstanding loans and commitments by all
reporting banks. Although some banks are reviewed twice a year, the agencies issue a single
statement annually that captures combined findings from the previous 12 months. The next
statement will be released upon completion of the third quarter 2024 SNC review.

Summary of Results

Overall, SNC credit risk increased but remains moderate. The trend reflects the pressure of higher
interest rates on leveraged borrowers and the impact of compressed operating margins in some
industry sectors. Commitments rated special mention and classified (non-pass) have increased
from 7.0 percent of total commitments in 2022 to 8.9 percent in 2023. The increase in the non-
pass rate is partially muted by growth in total commitments. U.S. and foreign banks continue to
own the largest share of SNC commitments, while nonbanks hold the largest share of special
mention and classified loans. Nonbank holdings are concentrated in non-investment grade term
loans identified and reported as leveraged by agent banks.

The agencies continue to select SNC transactions to review using a risk-based sampling
approach, which in 2023 focused on bank-identified leveraged loans, special mention and
classified loans, and loans to borrowers in stressed industry segments (2023 Focus Industries as
defined on page 6). Asset quality measures and trends in the composition of SNC commitments
by major industry group1 are provided in Appendix C.

The higher rate of special mention and classified commitments in 2023 is driven by declining credit
quality in Technology, Telecom, and Media as well as Health Care and Pharmaceutical industry
segments. Technology, Telecom and Media comprise one-third of the total special mention and
classified commitments. While the overall level of special mention and classified commitments in
the real estate sector remains below the portfolio average, the office sub-sector reflects weakness
because of secular changes in the workplace. Industries affected by the pandemic, including
Transportation Services and Entertainment/Recreation, continue to show notable improvement.

The magnitude and direction of risk in 2024 will be impacted by borrowers’ ability to manage
through shifts in interest rates, the commercial real estate sector, and other external

    The agencies introduced industry data in 2008 that presented industries vertically along product origination and distribution lines. The
     review places borrowers in seven primary sectors, largely following the outline of the 2017 U.S. Census Bureau North American
     Industry Classification System codes (see appendix C).
                                                                  -2-
 factors. These conditions will continue to impact the financial performance and repayment
capacity of borrowers in a wide variety of industries, especially highly leveraged borrowers that
may lack the financial flexibility to respond to external challenges.

Leveraged Loans

Credit risk associated with leveraged lending remains high. While leveraged loans comprise
nearly half of total SNC commitments, they represent a disproportionately high percent of the total
special mention and classified exposures. SNC reviews continue to note that many leveraged
loans contain weak structures. These structures often reflect layered risks that include some
combination of high leverage, aggressive repayment assumptions, weak covenants, or terms that
allow borrowers to increase debt, including draws on incremental facilities.

The volume of leveraged transactions exhibiting layered risks increased significantly over the past
several years, as strong investor demand for loans enabled borrowers to obtain less restrictive
terms. To date, the performance of these leveraged loans has not been tested through a typical
economic cycle. The agencies continue to focus on assessing the impact of layered risks in
leveraged lending transactions and the appropriateness of credit risk management practices in
adapting to the changing environment.

Nonbank entities continue to participate in the leveraged lending market to earn returns from
holding purchased credit exposure. These nonbank entities hold a significant portion of non-pass
leveraged commitments and non-investment grade2 equivalent leveraged term loans. By
comparison, the SNC leveraged exposure held at banks is primarily comprised of investment
grade equivalent revolving credit facilities. However, the agencies note that these investment
preferences are not universal as risk appetite varies among bank and nonbank participants.

Banks appropriately manage leveraged lending exposure by employing risk management
processes that adhere to regulatory safety and soundness standards and adapt to changing
economic conditions. Portfolio management and stress testing processes should consider that
loss and recovery rates may differ from historical levels, and risks identified in stress tests should
be measured against their potential impact on capital and earnings.

SNC Commitments: Volume, Credit Quality, and Trends

Overall SNC Population

The 2023 SNC commitments totaled $6.4 trillion. Total commitments increased by $512 billion, or
8.7 percent year-over-year, with an increase of $438 billion in loans reported as investment grade
by agent banks. Outstanding balances increased by 7.3 percent over the same timeframe.
Additionally, the number of borrowers and credit facilities increased by 6.0 percent in 2023 (see
exhibits 1 and 2).

 Exhibit 1: Overall Credit Facilities and Commitment Trends




Note: The decline in the number of SNC credit facilities between 2017 and 2018 mainly reflects the minimum commitment increase from
$20 million to $100 million.


Exhibit 2 details the year-over-year changes in aggregate SNC commitment amounts and reflects
the increase in the level of special mention (referred to as “SM” in the table below) and classified
SNC commitments.

Exhibit 3 shows trends in the dollar volume of special mention plus classified commitments as a

represent 8.9 percent of total commitments, with a classified rate of 6.2 percent and a special
mention rate of 2.7 percent. Absent growth in the portfolio that can dilute building risk, the special

 mention and classified rate would total 9.7 percent. The non-pass rate remains above the 2019
pre-pandemic level of 6.9 percent.

Leveraged Lending

Agent bank-identified leveraged loans represent 46 percent of total SNC commitments, 86 percent
of special mention commitments, and 85 percent of classified commitments. Total agent bank-
identified leveraged loan commitments grew modestly by $78 billion or 2.7 percent between 2022
and 2023. Newly originated agent bank-identified leveraged lending remains a primary focus of
SNC review samples given the volume, asset quality, and layered underwriting risk within the
segment. The 2023 SNC sample covered 35 percent of agent bank-identified leveraged lending
commitments and 28 percent of agent bank-identified leveraged borrowers (see exhibit 4).

Exhibit 4: SNC Leveraged Lending Exposure and Review Sample




Banks hold $1.8 trillion or 61 percent of agent bank-identified leveraged loans, most of which
consists of higher rated and investment grade equivalent revolvers. Nonbanks primarily hold non-
investment grade equivalent term loans (see exhibit 5).

2023 Focus Industries

The agencies focused on the Health Care and Pharmaceuticals; Real Estate and Construction;
Technology, Telecom and Media; and Transportation Services industry segments in 2023. These
industries showed high and/or increasing special mention and classified rates. The agencies
targeted sub-groups within these industries that had greater vulnerability to rising interest rates and
other macroeconomic factors.

Exhibit 6 illustrates trends in the level of special mention and classified as a percentage of total
commitments within the four focused industry segments. While Transportation Services shows
improvement, it remains the highest special mention and classified rate at 22.1 percent, followed
by Technology, Telecom and Media at 19.3 percent and Health Care and Pharmaceuticals at 14.4
percent. As reflected in exhibit 7, risk in Commercial Real Estate varies by sub-sector, with special
mention and classified commitments increasing in Office and decreasing in the Hotel and Lodging
property type. While exhibit 7 illustrates that banks own a higher percentage of non-pass
commitments, the current non-pass rate for Commercial Real Estate is relatively low at 5.7
percent.

SNC Commitments: Ownership of Risk

As has been the case for several years, U.S. Banks hold the largest amount of SNC commitments,
followed by Foreign Banking Organizations (FBOs) and Nonbanks (see exhibit 8).

Nonbanks continue to hold a disproportionate share of all loan commitments rated special mention
and classified (see exhibit 9). U.S. Banks and FBOs held 78.9 percent of the total exposure, but
only 35.0 percent of the non-pass exposure. The special mention and classified rates at U.S.
Banks and FBOs are 3.8 percent and 4.2 percent, respectively, while the special mention and
classified rate at Nonbanks is 27.5 percent.

 Appendix A: Definitions

Agent Bank: Agent Bank is defined as a federally supervised institution that originates or
administers a SNC for the syndication or participating lenders.

Classified Commitments: Classified commitments include commitments rated substandard,
doubtful, and loss as defined below.

Credit Facilities: Credit facilities include syndicated loans and loan commitments, letters of
credit, commercial leases, and other forms of credit. Commitment amounts include both drawn
and undrawn portions of the loans or credit facilities. The SNC review reports only the par
amounts of commitments, which may differ from the amounts at which loans are carried by
investors.

Doubtful: Doubtful commitments have all the weaknesses of commitments classified
substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in
full, on the basis of available current information, highly questionable and improbable.

Loss: Commitments classified as loss are uncollectible and of so little value that their
continuance as bankable commitments is not warranted. Amounts classified as loss should be
promptly charged off. This classification does not mean that there is no recovery or salvage
value, but rather that it is not practical or desirable to defer writing off these commitments, even
though some value may be recovered in the future.

Nonaccrual: Nonaccrual loans are defined for regulatory reporting purposes as loans and lease
financing receivables that are required to be reported on a nonaccrual basis because (a) they are
maintained on a cash basis owing to a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower, (b)
payment in full of interest or principal is not expected, or (c) principal or interest has been in default
for 90 days or longer, unless the obligation is both well secured and in the process of collection.

Non-pass: A non-pass loan is any loan rated special mention, substandard, doubtful, or loss.

Pass: A credit facility that is in good standing and is not rated special mention or classified in any
way.

Shared National Credit (SNC): A SNC is any loan or formal commitment, and any asset such as
real estate, stocks, notes, bonds, and debentures taken as debts previously contracted, extended
to borrowers by a federally supervised institution, its subsidiaries, and affiliates, that aggregates
to $100 million or more and is shared by three or more unaffiliated federally supervised
institutions, or a portion of which is sold to two or more such institutions.

Special Mention (SM): Special mention commitments have potential weaknesses that deserve
management's close attention. If left uncorrected, these potential weaknesses could result in
further deterioration of the repayment prospects or in the institution's credit position in the future.
Special mention commitments are not adversely classified and do not expose institutions to
sufficient risk to warrant adverse rating.

Substandard: Substandard commitments are inadequately protected by the current sound worth
and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. Substandard commitments
have well-defined weaknesses that jeopardize the liquidation of the debt and present the distinct
possibility that the institution will sustain some loss if deficiencies are not corrected.

                  (h)    enhanced procedures and monitoring systems to ensure that deteriorating

credits are promptly identified, properly risk rated, and accurately and timely placed on the

watch list; and

                  (i)    written reports to the board of directors, at least quarterly, that identify and

report the status of loans that are nonperforming or adversely graded, the prospects for full

collection or strengthening of the quality of any such loans, and the steps that the Bank will take

to reduce the exposure to each nonperforming or adversely graded loan.

Asset Improvement

        6.        The Bank shall not, directly or indirectly, extend, renew, or restructure any credit

to or for the benefit of any borrower, including any related interest of the borrower, whose loans

or other extensions of credit are criticized in the examination of the Bank, dated April 13, 2023

or August 31, 2023 (the “Reports of Examination”), conducted by the Reserve Bank and KDFI,

or in any subsequent report of examination conducted by the Reserve Bank and KDFI, without




                                                    5
 the prior approval of a majority of the full board of directors or a designated committee thereof.

The board of directors or its committee shall document in writing the reasons for the extension of

credit, renewal, or restructuring, specifically certifying that: (i) the Bank’s risk management

policies and practices for loan workout activity are acceptable; (ii) the extension of credit is

necessary to improve and protect the Bank’s interest in the ultimate collection of the credit

already granted and maximize its potential for collection; (iii) the extension of credit reflects

prudent underwriting based on reasonable repayment terms and is adequately secured; and all

necessary loan documentation has been properly and accurately prepared and filed; (iv) the Bank

has performed a comprehensive credit analysis indicating that the borrower has the willingness

and ability to repay the debt as supported by an adequate workout plan, as necessary; and (v) the

board of directors or its designated committee reasonably believes that the extension of credit

will not impair the Bank’s interest in obtaining repayment of the already outstanding credit and

that the extension of credit or renewal will be repaid according to its terms. The written

certification shall be made a part of the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors or its

committee, as appropriate, and a copy of the signed certification, together with the credit analysis

and related information that was used in the determination, shall be retained by the Bank in the

borrower’s credit file for subsequent supervisory review. For purposes of this Agreement, the

term “related interest” is defined as set forth in section 215.2(n) of Regulation O of the Board of

Governors (12 C.F.R. § 215.2(n)).

         7.    (a)     Within 30 days of the effective date of this Agreement, the Bank shall

submit a written plan acceptable to the Reserve Bank and KDFI designed to improve the Bank’s

position through repayment, amortization, liquidation, additional collateral, or other means on

each loan, relationship, or other asset in excess of $200,000, including other real estate owned

Order Approving the Merger of Bank Holding Companies, the Merger of Banks, and the
                            Establishment of Branches

               Atlantic Union Bankshares Corporation (“AUB”), Richmond, Virginia, a
bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act (“BHC
Act”),1 has requested the Board’s approval under section 3 of the BHC Act2 to acquire
American National Bankshares Inc. (“American National”) and thereby indirectly acquire
its national bank subsidiary, American National Bank and Trust Company (“American
National Bank”), both of Danville, Virginia. In addition, AUB’s subsidiary state member
bank, Atlantic Union Bank, Richmond, Virginia, has requested the Board’s approval to
merge with American National Bank pursuant to section 18(c) of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act (“Bank Merger Act”),3 with Atlantic Union Bank as the surviving entity.
Atlantic Union Bank also has applied under section 9 of the Federal Reserve Act
(“FRA”)4 to establish and operate branches at the locations of the main office and
branches of American National Bank.
               Notice of the proposal, affording interested persons an opportunity to
submit comments, has been published (88 Federal Register 64,432 (September 19,

 2023)), in accordance with the Board’s Rules of Procedure.5 The time for submitting
comments has expired, and the Board received two adverse comments on the proposal.
The Board has considered the proposal and the comments received in light of the factors
set forth in section 3 of the BHC Act, the Bank Merger Act, and the FRA. As required by
the Bank Merger Act, a report on the competitive effects of the merger was requested
from the United States Attorney General, and a copy of the request has been provided to
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”).
               AUB, with consolidated assets of approximately $20.7 billion, is the
93rd largest insured depository organization in the United States.6 AUB controls
approximately $16.8 billion in consolidated deposits, which represent less than 1 percent
of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United States.7
AUB controls Atlantic Union Bank, which operates in Virginia, North Carolina, and
Maryland. Atlantic Union Bank is the 5th largest insured depository institution in
Virginia, controlling deposits of approximately $16 billion, which represent
approximately 5.3 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in that state. Atlantic Union Bank is the 44th largest insured depository
institution in North Carolina, controlling deposits of approximately $324 million, which
represent approximately less than 1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured
depository institutions in that state.
               American National, with consolidated assets of approximately $3.1 billion,
is the 364th largest insured depository organization in the United States. American
National controls approximately $2.6 billion in consolidated deposits, which represent
less than 1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the

insured depository institutions include commercial banks, savings associations, and

Virginia and North Carolina.8 American National Bank is the 20th largest insured
depository institution in Virginia, controlling deposits of approximately $1.9 billion,
which represent less than 1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in that state. American National Bank is the 31st largest insured depository
institution in North Carolina, controlling deposits of approximately $748 million, which
represent less than 1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository
institutions in that state.
                On consummation of this proposal, AUB would become the 86th largest
insured depository organization in the United States, with consolidated assets of
approximately $23.9 billion, which would represent less than 1 percent of the total assets
of insured depository organizations in the United States. AUB would control total
consolidated deposits of approximately $19.3 billion, which would represent less than
1 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in the United
States.
Interstate Analysis
                Section 3(d) of the BHC Act generally provides that, if certain conditions
are met, the Board may approve an application by a bank holding company that is well
capitalized and well managed to acquire control of a bank located in a state other than the
home state of the bank holding company without regard to whether the transaction would
be prohibited under state law.9 The Board may not approve under this provision an
application that would permit an out-of-state bank holding company to acquire a bank in
a host state if the target bank has not been in existence for the lesser of the state statutory
minimum period of time or five years.10 When determining whether to approve an

  The proposal does not raise interstate issues under section 44 of the Federal Deposit
Insurance Act because Virginia is the home state of Atlantic Union Bank and American
National Bank. See 12 U.S.C. §§ 1831u(a)(1) and (g)(4).

 application under this provision, the Board must take into account the record of the
applicant’s depository institution under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977
(“CRA”)11 and the applicant’s record of compliance with applicable state community
reinvestment laws.12 In addition, the Board may not approve an interstate application
under this provision if the bank holding company controls or, upon consummation of the
proposed transaction, would control more than 10 percent of the total deposits of insured
depository institutions in the United States or, in certain circumstances, if the bank
holding company, upon consummation, would control 30 percent or more of the total
deposits of insured depository institutions in any state in which the acquirer and target
have overlapping banking operations.13
               For purposes of the BHC Act, the home state of AUB is Virginia.14
American National Bank is located in Virginia and North Carolina. AUB is well
capitalized and well managed under applicable law. Atlantic Union Bank has a
“Satisfactory” rating under the CRA, and Virginia does not have a state community
reinvestment law. American National Bank has been in existence for more than five
years.
               On consummation of the proposed transaction, AUB would control less
than 1 percent of the total amount of consolidated deposits in insured depository
institutions in the United States. Of the states in which Atlantic Union Bank and

   12 U.S.C. § 1842(d)(2)(A) and (B). For purposes of section 3(d) of the BHC Act, the
acquiring and target organizations have overlapping banking operations in any state in
which any bank to be acquired is located and the acquiring bank holding company
controls any insured depository institution or a branch. The Board considers a bank to be
located in the states in which the bank is chartered, is headquartered, or operates a
branch. See 12 U.S.C. § 1841(o)(4)–(7).
14
   12 U.S.C. § 1841(o)(4). A bank holding company’s home state is the state in which
the total deposits of all banking subsidiaries of such company were the largest on
July 1, 1966, or the date on which the company became a bank holding company,
whichever is later.

 American National Bank have overlapping banking operations, Virginia and North
Carolina do not impose a limit. The combined organization would control approximately
5.9 percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions in Virginia
and less than 1 percent in North Carolina. Accordingly, in light of all the facts of record,
the Board is not precluded from approving the proposal under section 3(d) of the BHC
Act.
Competitive Considerations
               Section 3 of the BHC Act and the Bank Merger Act prohibit the Board
from approving a proposal that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of
an attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any relevant market.15 The BHC
Act and the Bank Merger Act also prohibit the Board from approving a proposal that
would substantially lessen competition or tend to create a monopoly in any banking
market, unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposal are clearly outweighed in the
public interest by the probable effect of the proposal in meeting the convenience and
needs of the communities to be served.16
               AUB and American National have subsidiary banks that compete directly
in three markets located in Virginia. The Board has considered the competitive effects of
the proposal in these banking markets. In particular, the Board has considered the
relative share of total deposits in insured depository institutions in the markets (“market
deposits”) that AUB would control;17 the concentration levels of market deposits and the

     12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(1)(A); 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c)(5)(A).

   Local deposit and market share data are as of June 30, 2023, and are based on
calculations in which the deposits of thrift institutions are included at 50 percent. The
Board previously has indicated that thrift institutions have become, or have the potential
to become, significant competitors to commercial banks. See, e.g., Midwest Financial
Group, 75 Federal Reserve Bulletin 386 (1989); National City Corporation, 70 Federal
Reserve Bulletin 743 (1984). Thus, the Board regularly has included thrift deposits in
market share calculations on a 50 percent weighted basis. See, e.g., Huntington
Bancshares Incorporated, FRB Order No. 2021-07, at 5–6 (May 25, 2021); Hancock
Whitney Corporation, FRB Order No. 2019-12 at 6 (September 5, 2019).

 increase in these levels, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (“HHI”) under
the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) Bank Merger Competitive Review guidelines (“DOJ
Bank Merger Guidelines”);18 the number of competitors that would remain in each
market; and other characteristics of the market.
              Consummation of the proposal would be consistent with Board precedent
and within the thresholds in the DOJ Bank Merger Guidelines in each of the three
banking markets in which AUB’s and American National’s subsidiary banks compete.
On consummation, the three markets would remain moderately concentrated, as
measured by the HHI, according to the DOJ Bank Merger Guidelines, and the change in
the HHI in each market would be small. Numerous competitors would remain in the
markets.19
              The DOJ also has conducted a review of the potential competitive effects of
the proposal and has advised the Board that it did not conclude that the proposal would
have a significantly adverse effect on competition. In addition, the appropriate banking



18
   In applying the DOJ Bank Merger Guidelines issued in 1995 (see
https://www.justice.gov/atr/bank-merger-competitive-review-introduction-and-overview-
1995), the Board looks to the DOJ’s Horizontal Merger Guidelines issued in 1992, and
amended in 1997, for the characterization of a market’s concentration. See
https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-0. Under these Horizontal
Merger Guidelines, which were in effect prior to 2010, a market is considered
unconcentrated if the post-merger HHI is under 1000, moderately concentrated if the
post-merger HHI is between 1000 and 1800, and highly concentrated if the post-merger
HHI exceeds 1800. The DOJ has informed the Board that a bank merger or acquisition
generally would not be challenged (in the absence of other factors indicating
anticompetitive effects) unless the post-merger HHI is at least 1800 and the merger
increases the HHI by more than 200 points. Although the DOJ and the Federal Trade
Commission issued revised Horizontal Merger Guidelines in 2010 (see
https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010), the DOJ has
confirmed that its Bank Merger Guidelines, which were issued in 1995, were not
modified. See Press Release, Department of Justice (Aug. 19, 2010), available at
www.justice.gov/opa/pr/2010/August/10-at-938.html.

  These banking markets and the competitive effects of the proposal in these markets are
described in Appendix II.

 agencies have been afforded an opportunity to comment and have not objected to the
proposal.
                Based on all the facts of record, the Board concludes that consummation of
the proposal would not have a significantly adverse effect on competition, or on the
concentration of resources, in any relevant banking market. Accordingly, the Board
determines that competitive considerations are consistent with approval.
Financial, Managerial, and Other Supervisory Considerations
                In reviewing proposals under section 3 of the BHC Act and the Bank
Merger Act, the Board considers the financial and managerial resources and the future
prospects of the institutions involved, the effectiveness of the institutions in combatting
money laundering, and any public comments on the proposal.20 In its evaluation of
financial factors, the Board reviews information regarding the financial condition of the
organizations involved on both parent-only and consolidated bases, as well as
information regarding the financial condition of the subsidiary depository institutions and
the organizations’ significant nonbanking operations. In this evaluation, the Board
considers a variety of public and supervisory information regarding capital adequacy,
asset quality, liquidity, and earnings performance, as well as any public comments on the
proposal. The Board evaluates the financial condition of the combined organization,
including its capital position, asset quality, liquidity, earnings prospects, and the impact
of the proposed funding of the transaction. The Board also considers the ability of the
organization to absorb the costs of the proposal and to complete the proposed integration
of the operations of the institutions effectively. In assessing financial factors, the Board
considers capital adequacy to be especially important. The Board considers the future
prospects of the organizations involved in the proposal in light of their financial and
managerial resources and the proposed business plan.
                AUB, American National, and their subsidiary depository institutions are
well capitalized, and the combined organization would remain so upon consummation of


20
     12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2), (5), and (6); 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c)(5) and (11).

                                             -7-
 the proposal. The proposed transaction is a bank holding company merger that is
structured as a share exchange, with an immediately subsequent merger of American
National’s subsidiary depository institution into Atlantic Union Bank.21 The capital,
asset quality, earnings, and liquidity of AUB, American National, and their subsidiary
depository institutions are consistent with approval, and AUB appears to have adequate
resources to absorb the related costs of the proposal and to complete the integration of the
institutions’ operations effectively. In addition, the future prospects of the institutions are
considered consistent with approval.
              The Board also has considered the managerial resources of the
organizations involved and of the proposed combined organization. The Board has
reviewed the examination records of AUB, American National, and their subsidiary
depository institutions, including assessments of their management, risk-management
systems, and operations. In addition, the Board has considered information provided by
AUB; the Board’s supervisory experiences and those of other relevant bank supervisory
agencies with the organizations; the organizations’ records of compliance with applicable
banking, consumer protection, and anti-money-laundering laws; and the public comments
on the proposal.
              AUB, American National, and their subsidiary depository institutions are
each considered to be well managed. The combined organization’s proposed directors
and senior executive officers have knowledge of and experience in the banking and
financial services sectors, and AUB’s risk-management program appears consistent with
approval of this expansionary proposal.
              The Board also has considered AUB’s plans for implementing the proposal.
AUB has conducted comprehensive due diligence and is devoting significant financial
and other resources to address all aspects of the post-acquisition integration process for


21
   To effect the transaction, each share of American National common stock, excluding
certain shares owned by AUB or American National, would be converted into a right to
receive shares of AUB common stock, based on an exchange ratio, plus cash in lieu of
any fractional shares. AUB has the financial resources to effect the proposed transaction.

                                              -8-
 this proposal. In addition, AUB’s management has the experience and resources to
operate the resulting organization in a safe and sound manner, and AUB plans to
integrate American National’s existing management and personnel in a manner that
augments AUB’s management.
              Based on all the facts of record, including AUB’s and American National’s
supervisory records, managerial and operational resources, and plans for operating the
combined organization after consummation, the Board determines that considerations
relating to the financial and managerial resources and the future prospects of the
organizations involved in the proposal, as well as the records of effectiveness of AUB,
American National, and their subsidiary depository institutions in combatting money-
laundering activities, are consistent with approval.
Convenience and Needs Considerations
              In acting on a proposal under section 3 of the BHC Act and the Bank
Merger Act, the Board considers the effects of the proposal on the convenience and needs
of the communities to be served.22 In evaluating whether the proposal satisfies the
convenience and needs statutory factor, the Board considers the impact that the proposal
will or is likely to have on the communities served by the combined organization. The
Board reviews a variety of information to determine whether the relevant institutions’
records demonstrate a history of helping to meet the needs of their customers and
communities. The Board also reviews the combined institution’s post-consummation
plans and the expected impact of those plans on the communities served by the combined
institution, including on low- and moderate-income (“LMI”) individuals and
communities. The Board considers whether the relevant institutions are helping to meet
the credit needs of the communities they serve and are providing access to banking
products and services that meet the needs of customers and communities, including the
potential impact of branch closures, consolidations, and relocations on that access. In

22
  12 U.S.C. § 1842(c)(2); 12 U.S.C. § 1828(c)(5). Where applicable, the Board also
considers any timely substantive comments on the proposal and, in its discretion, may
consider any untimely substantive comments on the proposal.

                                            -9-
 addition, the Board reviews the records of the relevant depository institutions under the
CRA. The Board strongly encourages insured depository institutions to help meet the
credit needs of the local communities in which they operate, consistent with the
institutions’ safe and sound operation and their obligations under the CRA.23
               In addition, the Board considers the banks’ overall compliance records and
recent fair lending examinations. Fair lending laws require all lending institutions to
provide applicants with equal access to credit, regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender,
or certain other characteristics. The Board also considers assessments of other relevant
supervisors, the supervisory views of examiners, other supervisory information,
information provided by the applicant, and public comments on the proposal.24 The
Board also may consider the acquiring institution’s business model and intended
marketing and outreach, the combined organization’s plans after consummation, and any
other information the Board deems relevant.
               In assessing the convenience and needs factor in this case, the Board has
considered all the facts of record, including reports of examination of the CRA
performance of Atlantic Union Bank and American National Bank; the fair lending and
compliance records of both banks; the supervisory views of the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency (“OCC”), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and the
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond (“Richmond Reserve Bank”); confidential
supervisory information; information provided by AUB; and the public comments
received on the proposal.
               Public Comments on the Proposal
               The Board received two adverse comments on the proposal, both from the
same commenter, and one comment in support of the proposal. The adverse commenter
objected to the proposal, alleging in its first letter that, in 2022, Atlantic Union Bank


23
     See 12 U.S.C. § 2901(b).
24
  As noted above, where applicable, the Board, in its discretion, may consider any
untimely substantive comments on the proposal.

                                             -10-
 made fewer home loans to African American individuals as compared to white
individuals and noting an overdraft class-action lawsuit that Atlantic Union Bank settled
in 2021, the underlying issues of which the commenter said Atlantic Union Bank did not
fully resolve in the settlement. The second comment letter from the adverse commenter
referred to the December 7, 2023, consent order issued by the CFPB to Atlantic Union
Bank in regards to Atlantic Union Bank’s overdraft fee practices. The comment in
support of the proposal praised Atlantic Union’s investments in the commenter’s
community development loan fund and support for the commenter’s community
development financial institution bank.
              Businesses of the Involved Institutions and Response to the Public
         Comments
              Through Atlantic Union Bank, AUB offers products related to community
banking. These products include checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of
deposit, and depository services; loans for commercial, industrial, residential mortgage,
and consumer purposes; and wealth management services. Through Atlantic Union
Bank’s wholly owned subsidiaries, AUB offers equipment-financing services, wealth
management, and investment services through a relationship with a registered broker-
dealer. Additionally, Atlantic Union Bank offers credit cards and ATM services through
arrangements with partners.
              In response to the comments, AUB states Atlantic Union Bank’s denial
rates for black applicants compared to white applicants are comparable to those of its
peer institutions. Atlantic Union Bank denies applications across both racial groups for
the same reasons and conducts independent second-level reviews of substantially all
denied applications. Atlantic Union Bank is also engaged in continuing efforts to deepen
its presence in majority-minority communities. With respect to the settled class-action
lawsuit, AUB states Atlantic Union Bank settled it with no admission of wrongdoing,
altered the challenged disclosure practices, and voluntarily took steps to reduce the
incidence of overdraft fees that were the subject of the challenged disclosure practices.


                                            -11-
 AUB asserts that Atlantic Union Bank’s record of CRA performance and compliance
with fair lending laws and other regulations are consistent with approval of the proposal.
               Records of Performance under the CRA
               In evaluating the CRA performance of the involved institutions, the Board
generally considers each institution’s most recent CRA evaluation and the supervisory
views of relevant federal supervisors, which in this case are the Richmond Reserve Bank
with respect to Atlantic Union Bank and the OCC with respect to American National
Bank.25 In addition, the Board considers information provided by the applicant and
public commenters.
               The CRA requires that the appropriate federal financial supervisor for a
depository institution prepare a written evaluation of the institution’s record of helping to
meet the credit needs of its entire community, including LMI neighborhoods.26 An
institution’s most recent CRA performance evaluation is a particularly important
consideration in the applications process because it represents a detailed, on-site
evaluation by the institution’s primary federal supervisor of the institution’s overall
record of lending in its communities.
               In general, federal financial supervisors apply a lending test (“Lending
Test”), an investment test (“Investment Test”), and a service test (“Service Test”) to
evaluate the performance of large banks, such as Atlantic Union Bank and American
National Bank, in helping to meet the credit needs of the communities they serve. The
Lending Test specifically evaluates an institution’s lending-related activities to determine
whether the institution is helping to meet the credit needs of individuals and geographies
of all income levels. As part of the Lending Test, examiners review and analyze an
institution’s data reported under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975

 (“HMDA”),27 in addition to small business, small farm, and community development
loan data collected and reported under the CRA regulations, to assess an institution’s
lending activities with respect to borrowers and geographies of different income levels.
The institution’s lending performance is evaluated based on a variety of factors, including
(1) the number and amounts of home mortgage, small business, small farm, and
consumer loans (as applicable) in the institution’s CRA assessment areas (“AAs”); (2) the
geographic distribution of the institution’s lending, including the proportion and
dispersion of the institution’s lending in its AAs and the number and amounts of loans in
low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income geographies; (3) the distribution of loans
based on borrower characteristics, including, for home mortgage loans, the number and
amounts of loans to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income individuals;28 (4) the
institution’s community development lending, including the number and amounts of
community development loans and their complexity and innovativeness; and (5) the
institution’s use of innovative or flexible lending practices to address the credit needs of
LMI individuals and geographies.29 The Investment Test evaluates the number and
amounts of qualified investments that benefit the institution’s AAs. The Service Test
evaluates the availability and effectiveness of the institution’s systems for delivering
retail banking services and the extent and innovativeness of the institution’s community
development services.30
               The Board is concerned when HMDA data reflect disparities in the rates of
loan applications, originations, and denials among members of different racial, ethnic, or


27
     12 U.S.C. § 2801 et seq.
28
    Examiners also consider the number and amounts of small business and small farm
loans made to businesses and farms with gross annual revenues of $1 million or less;
small business and small farm loans by loan amount at origination; and consumer loans,
if applicable, to low-, moderate-, middle-, and upper-income individuals. See, e.g.,
12 CFR 228.22(b)(3).

     See 12 CFR 228.22(b).

     See 12 CFR 228.23 and 228.24.

                                            -13-
 gender groups in local areas. These types of disparities may indicate weaknesses in the
adequacy of policies and programs at an institution for meeting its obligations to extend
credit fairly. However, other information critical to an institution’s credit decisions may
not be available from public HMDA data.31 Consequently, the Board considers
additional information not available to the public that may be needed from the institution
and evaluates disparities in the context of the additional information obtained regarding
the lending and compliance record of an institution.
              CRA Performance of Atlantic Union Bank
              Atlantic Union Bank was assigned an overall rating of “Satisfactory” at its
most recent CRA performance evaluation by the Richmond Reserve Bank, as of May 17,
2021 (“Atlantic Union Bank Evaluation”).32 The bank received “High Satisfactory”
ratings for the Lending and Investment Tests, and a “Low Satisfactory” rating for the
Service Test.33
              With respect to the Lending Test, examiners found that Atlantic Union
Bank’s lending activity reflects an excellent responsiveness to local credit needs
consistent with the bank’s capacity and economic conditions. Examiners also found that
a substantial majority of the institution’s HMDA and small business and small farm loans
were originated within the bank’s AAs and that the overall geographic distribution
performance is considered excellent, while the borrower distribution performance is


31
  Importantly, credit scores are not available in the public HMDA data. Accordingly,
when conducting fair lending examinations, examiners analyze additional information not
available to the public before reaching a determination regarding an institution’s
compliance with fair lending laws.
32
   The Atlantic Union Bank Evaluation was conducted using Interagency Large
Institution CRA Examination Procedures. Examiners reviewed HMDA and CRA loan
originations and purchases from January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2019.
Examiners also reviewed community development activities since the previous
evaluation dated June 11, 2018.
33
   The Atlantic Union Bank Evaluation involved a full-scope review of the bank’s
activities in its Virginia Beach-Norfolk, VA-NC; Washington-Baltimore-Alexandria, VA;
Richmond, VA; Raleigh-Cary, NC; and Salisbury, MD, AAs.

                                            -14-
 considered adequate overall. Examiners noted that Atlantic Union Bank exhibits a good
record of serving the credit needs of low-income individuals and geographies as well as
very small businesses and farms. Examiners found that overall, Atlantic Union Bank
originated an adequate level of community development loans during the evaluation
period and made limited use of flexible lending practices in serving AA credit needs.
              With respect to the Investment Test, examiners found that Atlantic Union
Bank has a significant level of qualified community development investments that
demonstrate good responsiveness to local credit and community development needs and
that it makes occasional use of innovative and/or complex investments to support
community development initiatives.
              With respect to the Service Test, examiners determined that Atlantic Union
Bank’s delivery systems and branch locations are accessible to geographies and
individuals of different income levels within the institution’s AAs. Examiners found that
Atlantic Union Bank’s banking services do not vary in a way that inconveniences the
bank’s AAs, particularly to low- and moderate-income areas and/or people. Examiners
noted that Atlantic Union Bank’s opening of branch locations generally did not adversely
affect the accessibility of its delivery systems, particularly to low- and moderate-income
people and areas. Examiners also noted that, during the evaluation period, Atlantic
Union Bank provided an adequate level of qualified community development services
given its capacity and the available opportunities within its AAs.
              Atlantic Union Bank’s Efforts since the Atlantic Union Bank Evaluation
              AUB represents that, since the Atlantic Union Bank Evaluation, Atlantic
Union Bank has located its CRA program and CRA Officer under a Community Impact
Team that develops and manages Atlantic Union Bank’s CRA strategy and framework, as
well as their implementation, including documentation, monitoring, and reporting. The
Community Impact Team also stewards Atlantic Union Bank’s Corporate Community
Funding Strategy (including grants, donations, and participation in and funding of local
events) and drives an institutional focus on creating a positive impact in LMI
communities served by Atlantic Union Bank. Further, AUB represents that the

                                           -15-
 Community Impact Team promotes and makes available volunteer opportunities for
Atlantic Union Bank’s employees, including through a new Volunteer Ambassador
Program, and that in 2022, employees of Atlantic Union Bank donated 6,767 volunteer
hours to their communities, spread across 370 organizations. AUB also represents that
Atlantic Union Bank works to bring financial education and wellness resources to the
communities it serves, including through a partnership with Banzai—an online financial
literacy resource—to bring financial education into classrooms, and by offering financial
wellness tools and calculators to its customers, including through a partnership with
SavvyMoney.
              CRA Performance of American National Bank
              American National Bank was assigned an overall rating of “Satisfactory” at
its most recent CRA performance evaluation by the OCC, as of February 21, 2021
(“American National Bank Evaluation”).34 The bank received “Low Satisfactory” ratings
for the Lending, Investment, and Service Tests.35
              With respect to the Lending Test, in Virginia, examiners found that
American National Bank’s lending levels reflect good responsiveness to credit needs,
considering the number and amount of home mortgage and small business loans in the
AAs. Examiners also found that, in Virginia, the bank exhibited a good geographic
distribution of home mortgage loans and small business loans in the AAs. Examiners


34
   The American National Bank Evaluation was conducted using Interagency Large
Institution CRA Examination Procedures. Examiners reviewed small business and
HMDA-reportable loan data from January 1, 2020, through December 31, 2021.
Examiners also reviewed community development activities from March 19, 2020,
through November 7, 2022.
35
   The American National Bank Evaluation involved full-scope reviews of the bank’s
activities in its Southside Metropolitan Statistical Area (“MSA”), Roanoke MSA, and
Lynchburg MSA AAs, all of Virginia, and its Burlington MSA and Greensboro MSA
AAs, both of North Carolina. The American National Bank Evaluation also involved
limited-scope reviews of its Christiansburg MSA and Lovingston MSA AAs, both of
Viriginia, and its Winston-Salem MSA and Yanceyville Non-MSA AAs, both of North
Carolina.

                                           -16-
 noted that, in Virginia, American National Bank exhibited generally good distribution in
AAs of loans among individuals of different income levels and businesses of different
sizes, given the product lines offered by the institution. Examiners also noted that, in
Virginia, American National Bank made a relatively high level of community
development (“CD”) loans. In North Carolina, examiners found that lending levels
reflected adequate responsiveness to credit needs, considering the number and amount of
home mortgage and small business loans in the AAs. The examiners also found that, in
North Carolina, American National Bank exhibited an adequate geographic distribution
of home mortgage loans and small business loans in the AAs and exhibited an adequate
distribution of loans among individuals of different income levels and businesses of
different sizes, given the product lines offered by the institution. Examiners also noted
that American National Bank made an adequate level of CD loans in North Carolina.
              With respect to the Investment Test, examiners found that, in Virginia,
American National Bank has an adequate level of qualified CD investments and grants,
particularly those that are not routinely provided by private investors, although rarely in a
leadership position. In North Carolina, examiners found that American National Bank
has a low level of qualified CD investments and grants, particularly those that are not
routinely provided by private investors, although rarely in a leadership position.
              With respect to the Service Test, examiners determined that, in Virginia,
American National Bank’s branches and alternative delivery systems are accessible to
geographies and individuals of different income levels in its AAs. Examiners also found
that, in Virginia, American National Bank provided a relatively high level of CD
services, predominately in the Southside AA. In North Carolina, examiners found that
American National Bank’s branches and alternative delivery systems are reasonably
accessible to geographies and individuals of different income levels in its AAs.
Examiners also noted that American National Bank provided an adequate level of CD
services in North Carolina.

               Additional Supervisory Views
              In its review of the proposal, the Board consulted with and considered the
views of the Richmond Reserve Bank as the primary federal supervisor of Atlantic Union
Bank and the OCC as the primary federal supervisor of American National Bank. The
Board also considered the results of the most recent consumer compliance examinations
of Atlantic Union Bank and American National Bank, which included reviews of the
banks’ compliance management programs and compliance with consumer protection
laws and regulations, including fair lending. Lastly, the Board also considered the results
of the most recent consumer compliance examination of Atlantic Union Bank by the
CFPB.
              The Board has taken this information, as well as the CRA performance
records of Atlantic Union Bank and American National Bank, into account in evaluating
the proposal, including considering whether AUB has the experience and resources to
ensure that the combined organization would help meet the credit needs of the
communities to be served following consummation of the proposed transaction.
              Additional Convenience and Needs Considerations
              The Board also considers other potential effects of the proposal on the
convenience and needs of the communities to be served. This includes, for example, the
combined organization’s business model and intended marketing and outreach and
existing and anticipated product and service offerings in the communities to be served by
the organization; any additional plans the combined organization has for meeting the
needs of its communities following consummation; and any other information the Board
deems relevant. AUB represents that, following consummation of the proposal, it intends
to continue offering all products and services currently offered by each of Atlantic Union
Bank and American National Bank through the banks’ combined branch network.
              AUB further represents that, as a result of the transaction, the greater size of
the combined institution will allow for economies of scale in such areas as operations,
which will result in greater efficiencies and superior services. AUB also notes that
customers will benefit from an expanded, more convenient branch footprint and higher

                                            -18-
 lending limits, as well as an expanded set of product offerings for current customers of
American National Bank. AUB represents that Atlantic Union Bank and American
National Bank have a number of programs, products, and activities designed to meet the
needs of their respective communities.
               Branch Closures
               Physical branches remain important to many banking organizations’ ability
to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which they operate. When banking
organizations combine, whether through acquisitions, mergers, or consolidations, the
combination has the potential to increase or to reduce consumers’ and small businesses’
access to available credit and other banking services. Although the Board does not have
the authority to prohibit a bank from closing a branch, the Board focuses on the impact of
expected branch closures, consolidations, and relocations that occur in connection with a
proposal on the convenience and needs of the communities to be served by the resulting
institution. In particular, the Board considers the effect of any closures, consolidations,
or relocations on LMI communities.
               Federal banking law provides a specific mechanism for addressing branch
closings, including requiring that a bank provide notice to the public and the appropriate
federal supervisory agency before a branch is closed.36 In addition, the federal banking
supervisory agencies evaluate a bank’s record of opening and closing branches,
particularly branches located in LMI geographies or primarily serving LMI individuals,
as part of the CRA examination process.37
               AUB represents that branch closings and consolidations may occur in
connection with the proposed transaction. AUB asserts that any closures and
consolidations would be due to geographic overlap between branches. AUB maintains
that any consolidations should not have a significant effect on the services that customers

36
   See 12 U.S.C. § 1831r-1. The bank also is required to provide reasons and other
supporting data for the closure, consistent with the institution’s written policy for branch
closings.
37
     See, e.g., 12 CFR 228.24(d)(2).

                                            -19-
 of the consolidating branches currently receive. AUB asserts that customers of the
affected branches would receive closure notices consistent with the requirements of
applicable law.
              The Board has considered all the facts of record relating to branch closures,
consolidations, and relocations, including the records of the relevant depository
institutions under the CRA and fair lending laws in relation to branch closures; the
institutions’ policies and procedures on and records of compliance with federal banking
law regarding branch closures; the views of the OCC and the Richmond Reserve Bank;
confidential supervisory information; and information provided by AUB. Based on that
review, the Board concludes that Atlantic Union Bank has established policies, programs,
and procedures designed to ensure the bank’s branching network is consistent with the
bank’s CRA and fair lending obligations and to mitigate the impact of any branch
closures on communities to be served by the combined bank.
              Conclusion on Convenience and Needs Considerations
              The Board has considered all the facts of record, including the records of
the relevant depository institutions under the CRA, the institutions’ records of
compliance with fair lending and other consumer protection laws, supervisory
information, information provided by AUB, the public comments on the proposal, and
other potential effects of the proposal on the convenience and needs of the communities
to be served. Based on that review, the Board determines that the convenience and needs
factor is consistent with approval.
Establishment of Branches
              Atlantic Union Bank has applied under section 9 of the FRA to establish
branches at the current locations of American National Bank.38 The Board has assessed

38
   See 12 U.S.C. § 321. Under section 9 of the FRA, state member banks may establish
and operate branches on the same terms and conditions as are applicable to the
establishment of branches by national banks. A state member bank may retain any
branch following a merger that might be established as a new branch of the resulting bank
under state law, as well as any branch that was in operation on February 25, 1927, as a
branch of any bank. See 12 U.S.C. §§ 36(b)(2) and (c). Upon consummation, Atlantic
                                            -20-
 the factors it is required to consider when reviewing an application under that section,
including Atlantic Union Bank’s financial condition, management, capital, actions in
meeting the convenience and needs of the communities to be served, CRA performance,
and investment in bank premises.39 For the reasons discussed in this order, the Board
determines that those factors are consistent with approval.
Financial Stability Considerations
               Section 3 of the BHC Act requires the Board to consider “the extent to
which a proposed acquisition, merger, or consolidation would result in greater or more
concentrated risks to the stability of the United States banking or financial system.”40
               To assess the likely effect of a proposed transaction on the stability of the
United States banking or financial system, the Board considers a variety of metrics that
capture the systemic “footprint” of the resulting firm and the incremental effect of the
transaction on the systemic footprint of the acquiring firm. These metrics include
measures of the size of the resulting firm, the availability of substitute providers for any
critical products and services offered by the resulting firm, the interconnectedness of the
resulting firm with the banking or financial system, the extent to which the resulting firm
contributes to the complexity of the financial system, and the extent of the cross-border
activities of the resulting firm.41 These categories are not exhaustive, and additional
categories could inform the Board’s decision.
               In addition to these quantitative measures, the Board considers qualitative
factors, such as the opacity and complexity of an institution’s internal organization, that



Union Bank’s branches would be permissible under applicable state law. See Va. Code
Ann. § 6.2-831; N.C.G.S. § 52-224.13.

   12 CFR 208.6. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, Atlantic Union
Bank’s investments in bank premises would remain within the legal requirements of
section 208.21(a) of the Board’s Regulation H, 12 CFR 208.21(a).

   Many of the metrics considered by the Board measure an institution’s activities
relative to the United States financial system.

 are indicative of the relative degree of difficulty of resolving the resulting firm. A
financial institution that can be resolved in an orderly manner is less likely to inflict
material damage on the broader economy.42
               The Board’s experience has shown that proposals involving an acquisition
of less than $10 billion in total assets, or that result in a firm with less than $100 billion in
total assets, generally are not likely to pose systemic risks. Accordingly, the Board
presumes that a proposal does not raise material financial stability concerns if the assets
involved fall below either of these size thresholds, absent evidence that the transaction
would result in a significant increase in interconnectedness, complexity, cross-border
activities, or other risk factors.43
               In this case, the Board has considered information relevant to risks to the
stability of the United States banking or financial system. The proposal involves a target
with less than $10 billion in total assets and a pro forma organization with less than
$100 billion in total assets. Both the acquirer and the target are predominantly engaged
in retail and commercial banking activities.44 The pro forma organization would not
exhibit an organizational structure, complex interrelationships, or unique characteristics
that would complicate resolution of the firm in the event of financial distress. In
addition, the organization would not be a critical services provider or so interconnected

  For further discussion of the financial stability standard, see Bank of Montreal and
BMO Financial Corp., FRB Order No. 2023-01 at 43 (January 17, 2023), and Capital
One Financial Corporation, FRB Order No. 2012-2 (February 14, 2012).

(January 17, 2023), People’s United Financial, Inc., FRB Order No. 2017-08 at 25–26
(March 16, 2017). Notwithstanding this presumption, the Board has the authority to
review the financial stability implications of any proposal. For example, an acquisition
involving a global systemically important bank could warrant a financial stability review
by the Board, regardless of the size of the acquisition.

  AUB and American National offer a range of retail and commercial banking products
and services. AUB has, and as a result of the proposal would continue to have, a small
market share in these products and services on a nationwide basis.

 with other firms or the markets that it would pose a significant risk to the financial system
in the event of financial distress.
              In light of all the facts and circumstances, this transaction would not appear
to result in meaningfully greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the United
States banking or financial system. Based on these and all other facts of record, the
Board determines that considerations relating to financial stability are consistent with
approval.
Conclusion
              Based on the foregoing and all the facts of record, the Board determines
that the proposal should be, and hereby is, approved.45 In reaching its conclusion, the
Board has considered all the facts of record in light of the factors that it is required to
consider under the BHC Act and other applicable statutes. The Board’s approval is

   The adverse commenter requested that the Board hold public hearings on the proposal.
Under section 3(b) of the BHC Act, the Board must hold a public hearing on a proposal if
the appropriate supervisory authorities for the acquiring bank or the bank to be acquired
make a timely written recommendation of disapproval of the proposal.
12 U.S.C. § 1842(b); see also 12 CFR 225.16(e). The Board has not received such a
recommendation from the appropriate supervisory authorities. Under its rules, the Board,
in its discretion, may hold a public hearing if appropriate to allow interested persons an
opportunity to provide relevant testimony when written comments would not adequately
present their views. The Board has considered the adverse commenter’s request in light
of all the facts of record. In the Board’s view, the adverse commenter has had ample
opportunity to submit comments on the proposal and, in fact, submitted written
comments that the Board has considered in acting on the proposal. The adverse
commenter’s request does not identify disputed issues of fact that are material to the
Board’s decision and would be clarified by a public hearing. In addition, the request does
not demonstrate why written comments do not present the commenter’s views adequately
or why a hearing otherwise would be necessary or appropriate. For these reasons, and
based on all the facts of record, the Board has determined that a public hearing is not
required or warranted in this case. Accordingly, the request for public hearings on the
proposal is denied.
       The adverse commenter also requested an extension of the comment period for the
application. The adverse commenter’s request for additional time to comment did not
identify circumstances that would warrant an extension of the public comment period for
this proposal. Accordingly, the Board has determined not to extend the comment period.

                                             -23-
 specifically conditioned on compliance by AUB with all the conditions imposed in this
order and on any commitments made to the Board in connection with the proposal. The
Board’s approval also is conditioned on receipt by AUB of all required regulatory
approvals. For purposes of this action, the conditions and commitments are deemed to be
conditions imposed in writing by the Board in connection with its findings and decision
herein and, as such, may be enforced in proceedings under applicable law.
              The proposal may not be consummated before the 15th calendar day after
the effective date of this order or later than three months thereafter, unless such period is
extended for good cause by the Board or the Richmond Reserve Bank, acting under
delegated authority.
              By order of the Board of Governors,46 effective February 23, 2024.
